# Linear_reg_roboism
This is a linear regression model trained on the given train.csv data which predicts the values of y with the help of given x in test.csv file.

A funtion is created which takes the values of x, y, learning rate and no. of iterations to train itself.

It returns the slope and y-intercept of the predicted straight line, using which predictions are made for the values of y in test data.

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the model is: 3.0751488555137154.
